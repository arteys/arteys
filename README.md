### Hi there 👋

<!--
**arteys/arteys** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on microscopy image processing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python


LSM2.py - script that can open .LSM files from Carl Zeiss LSM710 microscope obtained in lambda mode and convert them into pseudo-realistic colored images (with heli of napari). I make this thing mostly for self-education, so it may (must) contain realy stupid mistakes and just strange things
